# Shell Deployer

Shell Deployer is a simple bash shell based deployment tool designed to streamline the deployment process of Laravel and Node.js projects via GitLab CI/CD pipelines. It simplifies the deployment steps, making it easy to deploy projects to various environments with minimal configuration.

## Getting Started

To use deployer in your project, add npx deployment script call in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the necessary configurations. Below are examples for both Laravel and Node.js projects.

### Node.js GitLab CI Example

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

.deploy: &deploy
  image: node:20-bullseye
  stage: deploy
  allow_failure: false
  when: manual
  tags:
    - deploy
  script:
    - npx -y -p shell-deployer@1.4.2 deploy-nodejs dist/spa/ --with-build

deploy to staging:
  <<: *deploy
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://nodejs-project.example.com
  variables:
    DEPLOY_HOST: staging.example.com
    DEPLOY_USER: example_user
    DEPLOY_PATH: /home/example_user/app
    DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS: $STAGING_DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS
    DEPLOY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: $STAGING_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Laravel GitLab CI Example
```yaml
.deploy: &deploy
  stage: deploy
  allow_failure: false
  when: manual
  tags:
    - deploy
  script:
    - npx --yes -p shell-deployer@1.4.2 deploy-laravel app.tgz --with-build

deploy to staging:
  <<: *deploy
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://laravel-project.example.com
  variables:
    DEPLOY_HOST: staging.example.com
    DEPLOY_USER: example_user
    DEPLOY_PHP_COMMAND: php8.3
    DEPLOY_PATH: /home/example_user/app
    DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS: $STAGING_DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS
    DEPLOY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: $STAGING_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Required Environment Variables

- **DEPLOY_HOST**: The hostname or IP address of the server where the project will be deployed.
- **DEPLOY_USER**: The username used to log into the server.
- **DEPLOY_PATH**: The path on the server where the project should be deployed. This script uses this path to create a `releases` directory where each release will be stored in a timestamped subdirectory. Latest release will be symlinked to `current` directory.

#### Optional Environment Variables

- **DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS**: Use this variable to specify custom SSH known hosts when deploying to servers that are not already in your `known_hosts` file, or when there is no existing and/or persistent `known_hosts` file, such as when deploying from a continuous integration (CI) environment. When defined, the script will append the specified known hosts information to the `known_hosts` file located at `$DEPLOY_SSH_PATH/known_hosts`. This ensures secure SSH connections to new servers or under customized deployment conditions.
- **DEPLOY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**: The actual SSH key as a string. This script dynamically creates an SSH key file at `DEPLOY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and sets the correct permissions (`chmod 600`). This is useful for CI/CD environments where you might not want to store the private key on the filesystem or in the image.
- **DEPLOY_SSH_PORT**: The port to use for SSH connections. If not set, the default SSH port `22` is used. This allows flexibility for deployments to servers configured to use non-standard SSH ports.
- **DEPLOY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH**: The path where the deployment script should store the SSH key used for the deployment. If not set, the script defaults to using `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`. This is critical if you're using a specific SSH key for deployment that isn't the default key.

#### Optional Laravel Environment Variables
- **DEPLOY_PHP_COMMAND**: PHP binary name on remote server. Either name (ex. `php8.3`) or full path (ex `/usr/bin/php8.3`) can be specified. If not set, the default name of `php` is used.
- **DEPLOY_SHARED_FILES**: List of `;` separated files in `DEPLOY_PATH/shared` directory to be symlinked against deployed release. If not set, the default value of `.env` is used.
- **DEPLOY_SHARED_DIRECTORIES**: List of `;` separated directories in `DEPLOY_PATH/shared` directory to be symlinked against deployed release. If not set, the default value of `storage` is used.
- **DEPLOY_SHARED_STORAGE_DIRECTORIES**: List of `;` separated directories in `DEPLOY_PATH/shared/storage` directory to be created. If not set, the default value of `app/public;framework/cache/data;framework/views;framework/sessions;logs` is used.
- **DEPLOY_ARTISAN_COMMANDS**: List of `;` separated artisan commands to be called to complete deployment process. If not set, the default value of `storage:link;config:cache;migrate --force;view:cache;queue:restart` is used.

### Laravel configuration

#### Deployment archive building

When building a Laravel deployment archive, the list of files and directories to exclude from the build package is specified in .buildignore, which can be found here: https://github.com/cube-agency/shell-deployer/blob/master/.buildignore.    
If you need a customized list of files and directories to ignore, create a file named .buildignore at the root of your project.

#### .env configuration

The deployment process assumes that `DEPLOY_PATH/shared/.env` exists. If it does not, an error will be thrown.

### Script Parameters

- **DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_PATH**: This is a required positional argument that specifies the source directory or file of the deployment. It must be passed when invoking the script.
- **--with-build**: This optional flag can be added as the last argument to the script to indicate that a build process should occur as part of the deployment. If not passed, see [build process](#build-process) for manual build process.

## Build process
The build process can also be executed by the deployer script.

Before initiating the deploy process, you can invoke a dedicated build script.

The build process will execute `npm i && npm run build` to construct the project as specified in package.json for both Node.js and Laravel builds.


#### Node.js
Use the command `npx -y -p shell-deployer@1.4.2 build-nodejs` to build.

The build result is the directory specified by `npm run build`.

#### Laravel
Use the command `npx -y -p shell-deployer@1.4.2 build-laravel` to build.

In addition to the Node.js `npm run build`, `composer install` will be executed to install all required dependencies, excluding dev packages.

The build result is an `app.tgz` file in the local directory, containing all files and directories from the current directory, except those specified in `.buildignore`.

## Miscellaneous

### Retrieving DEPLOY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS
Run the following command with the actual host or IP to output the content of known hosts to the console:   
`ssh-keyscan -p 22 HOST_OR_IP 2>/dev/null`
